# Audio-Orb-Visualizer
This project is a Circular Audio Spectrum Visualizer built in Python using matplotlib and sounddevice.
>Key Features:-
1)Real-time Visualization: Processes live audio (via a loopback device) to create a dynamic visual display.
2)Pulsing Orb: A central cyan-colored sphere that pulses and glows in response to the music's bass frequency.
3)Dynamic Bars: Frequency data is displayed as radially expanding bars around the orb, with subtle color change-s.
4)3D Illusion: Multiple inner rings and depth layers rotate and scale to create a sense of depth and dimension.
5)Aesthetics: Includes an optional motion blur effect on the orb and a reflection for a polished, high-energy look.
It requires a loopback audio device index to function.
