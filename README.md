# Circular Audio Spectrum Visualizer (Pygame + Sounddevice)

A real-time circular audio spectrum visualizer built with Python, Pygame, and Sounddevice.  
The visualization responds dynamically to live audio input, featuring 180 neon spectrum bars arranged in a rotating circular formation.  
Smooth radius transitions and bass-driven expansion create a fluid and immersive motion.  
The system also includes holographic inner rings that react inward to low frequencies, producing a subtle 3D depth effect.  
Motion blur, reflection, and color gradients combine to deliver a highly responsive and visually striking audio experience.

## Features
- Real-time FFT-based audio analysis  
- 180-bar circular spectrum with neon color gradients  
- Dynamic bass-driven radius expansion  
- Holographic inner rings with inward motion  
- Motion blur and reflection layers for visual depth  
- Fully customizable smoothing, sensitivity, and color behavior
